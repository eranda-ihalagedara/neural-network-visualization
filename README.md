# Neural Network Visualizer
A lightweight javascript library to visualize neural network models build on top of Three.js and TensorFlow.js. 

## Example
A demo of the library can be found in [here](https://eranda-ihalagedara.github.io/neural-network-visualization/index.html). It uses a neural network trained on MNIST dataset and visualize the activations taking in a drawing of a digit on a canvas.
